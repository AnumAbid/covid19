# COVID19 Hackathon by Nth Opinion

<b> Calling All Doctors & Coders: Global Hackathon to Defeat COVID-19: </b> <i> Connecting physicians & developers globally in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic </i>
<hr>
<i> Code vs COVID-19: Taking down a Pandemic using machines connected globally to extinguish a biological threat of a super virus. </i>

Our application is a web app. It has a public facing interface, and a doctor/healthcare worker facing interface. Users can search through a database of previously asked questions about COVID-19 (or add their question to the database if it hasn't already been asked), and obtain answers from medical professionals around the globe.

Our realtime database will contain the most urgent questions and answers on COVID-19 and publish it to the world. With our app in the hands of front line workers who have or are already experiencing the first wave, they can share their knowledge and help the health care workers who will be hit next.

<b>NOTICE:</b> This open source project is a work in progress. The best way to get onboarded and brought up to speed is to join our slack:

<i>Update March 15, 2020:</i> Please excuse the bugs as we are working hard to fix them on the fly! COVID-19 is spreading faster than we can code and as a result converted the project to open source overnight. We understand there are bugs and the code is not optimized. Thank you for working with us as we try to fix bugs on the fly! Don’t be shy, reach out, and get involved. 

Work in progress...


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
