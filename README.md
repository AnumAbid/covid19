<b> Calling All Doctors & Coders: Global Hackathon to Defeat COVID-19: </b> <i> Connecting physicians & developers globally in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic </i>
 
<i> Code vs COVID-19: Taking down a Pandemic using machines connected globally to extinguish a biological threat of a super virus. </i>
 
<b> SEATTLE, WA and VANCOUVER, BC, March 10, 2020 </b> -- Nth Opinion, an artificial intelligence healthtech firm founded by physicians, is putting out a global call for coders and physicians to help them employ state of the art web technologies to massively scale doctors’ abilities and tip the fight against COVID-19 by outpacing the virus in the dissemination of information to the frontlines.

The most reliable information to protect humanity comes from our frontline physicians in the field at a time when governmental bodies, institutions and public policies need the world to move quickly and break through. Physicians and medical staff desperately need to share experiences over massive distances across the globe as rapidly as the virus is spreading. As this virus spreads and new data becomes available, this is information that could be crucial to the fight where healthcare resources are limited. 

Given that no treatment exists for this virus right now, real-time data of experimental treatments is the only way to get the advantage that physicians need to slow or halt the virus at the forefront. Nth Opinion’s strategy enables computers to become one of the best weapons in defending the patient and arming the physician. 

We believe that there is no greater need and better time than now to unite together as a technological species to face mankind’s greatest threat, the pandemic of COVID-19. It is the most urgent need that humanity faces at this time.  

# Objective of Hackathon: Coders

Nth Opinion requires coders to help service and educate the front line healthcare workers who are tirelessly fighting this pandemic around the world. Thanks @JN for launching our public Git. Thanks @YC for seeding the initial source code. Thanks @NTO for making this happen!

Coder talents will revolutionize the current state of the physician electronic toolbox which have been less than par as well as embarrassingly and devastatingly limited. Coding abilities will help develop tools that do not currently exist and directly contribute to the fight against the pandemic that health-care workers are currently tirelessly fighting around the world.

COVID-19 is spreading faster than Nth Opinion can code and their coding physicians are needed in the field with patients, and cannot complete this globally imperative project quickly enough. <b> Please help Nth Opinion finish their code. </b>

Contribute to Hackathon by submitting issues and contributing code. Submitting issues means sending messages about errors in applications and suggesting ways to fix them. Contributing code involves sending pull requests with your corrections and improvements. If you are interested in joining the coding revolution, visit:

All skills are welcomed. Anyone anywhere around the world can contribute to this code. Even non-programmers can contribute. Documentation, translation, design, and community management are all needed. This is a time in our history that many of us have never lived through before, and we are advised that this is only the beginning. This project is poised to be an enormous part of the containment and elimination solution. 
 
# Objective of Hackathon: Physicians and Health Providers

Nth Opinion invites all physicians and health providers to share information with one another via the app. Doctors in North America have questions and they want to talk to those in Italy, Hong Kong, and other infected regions. Please create a physician account and help each other answer questions. Please put your Country in your answer. Our tool is decentralized and borderless so you don’t need to worry about getting approval from administrations. Our tool will inform other countries what is coming. It will let physicians tell doctors in other countries what they tried.  We need information from New York, Holland, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and China. 

To contribute as a physician or health provider, please email Nth Opinion to set up an account. Nth Opinion vets all applicants to ensure they are physicians and health providers. Email: signup@covid19webapp.com
